When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local? when you want to share the contents with users outside of your network
When you have a team of dev hacking the design

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You might not want the changes added to you remote repositry - its a control thing. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally? You can work off line

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Talk and comparing this would be easier as it is the old way. 
Using git and githup will only become easier when all the collaboraters are comfortable using it.   

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? 
What benefits does each approach have?
When collaborating with other devs and you want to sanaity check/peer review each others work pripr to updating the shared master
