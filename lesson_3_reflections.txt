When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local? when you want to share the contents with users outside of your network
When you have a team of dev hacking the design

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You might not want the changes added to you remote repositry - its a control thing. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally? You can work off line
